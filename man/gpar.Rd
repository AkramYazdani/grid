\title{Function to produce a Graphical Parameter Object}
\description{
  This function returns an object of class \code{"gpar"}.  This is
  basically a list of name-value pairs.
}
\usage{
gpar(...)
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{\dots}{ Any number of named arguments. }
}
\details{
  All grid viewports and (predefined) graphical objects have a slot
  called \code{gp}, which contains a \code{"gpar"} object.  When
  a viewport is pushed onto the viewport stack and when a graphical object
  is drawn, the settings in the \code{"gpar"} object are enforced.
  In this way, the graphical output is modified by the \code{gp}
  settings until the graphical object has finished drawing, or until the
  viewport is popped off the viewport stack, or until some other
  viewport or graphical object is pushed or begins drawing.
  }
\value{
  An object of class \code{"gpar"}.
